"The ""Total Unit Number"" reflects the property room count + 10%, rounded up to the nearest multiple of 25. The collateral is manufactured in packs of 25. 

The cost for Departmental and Individual collateral differs due to the price of markers. We send 20 markers for every 100 units. 

The ""Retail Price"" is what we charge customers. ""Departmental Landed Cost"" and ""Indivual Landed Cost"" reflect wholesale prices plus shipping, taxes, etc. ",,,,,
